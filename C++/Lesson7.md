# Udacity - C++ For Programmars Lesson 7: Functions

## C++ Functions must have
- A declaration: this is a statement of how the function is to be called.
- A definition: this is the statement(s) of the task the function performs when called

## C++ Functions can
- Accept parameters, but they are not required
- Return values, but a return value is not required
- Can modify parameters, if given explicit direction to do so

## Change Variable by function
- Return the altered variable
- Pass the variable as a reference: passing the address of the variable rather than the variable

## Three methods for passing an array by reference to a function:
- void functionName(variableType \*arrayName)
- void functionName(variableType arrayName[length of array])
- void functionName(variableType arrayName[])
