# Udacity - C++ For Programmars Lesson 9: Overloading

## Overloading
- allow us to use the same function name for different functions
- as long as the argument list is different, the compiler will be able to choose the correct definition
  - Different argument list means either the variable type is different and/or the number of arguments is different

## Use operator
- example: int operator + (Shape shapeIn){}
